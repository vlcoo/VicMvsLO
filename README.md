A **standalone mod** of the 2-10 player remake of the Mario vs. Luigi gamemode from New Super Mario Bros. DS.

This mod allows the player to create and upload custom levels, as well as browse and try out community creations easily! Bored of the same vanilla maps? Give it a try!

## Downloads

Still in progress. Downloads will be available soon.
