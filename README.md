A **standalone mod** of the 2-10 player remake of the Mario vs. Luigi gamemode from New Super Mario Bros. DS.

This mod introduces the concept of *"Match rules"*, a list of conditions that can trigger whatever the lobby's host desires! Win when dying? Get a mega mush when stomping on another player? Uh, sure, if you're into that sort of thing. Oh, it also has around *13 "Race maps"* where you can speedrun a classic NSMB level from start to finish!

Apart from that, the defining features of the original remake remain!
